What is DeepChem?
-----------------
DeepChem is a python library that provides a high quality open-source toolchain
for deep-learning in drug discovery, materials science, quantum chemistry, and
biology.

About Us
--------
DeepChem is possible due to notable contributions from many people including Peter Eastman, Evan Feinberg, Joe Gomes, Karl Leswing, Vijay Pande, Aneesh Pappu, Bharath Ramsundar and Michael Wu (alphabetical ordering). DeepChem was originally created by `Bharath Ramsundar <https://rbharath.github.io>`_ with encouragement and guidance from Vijay Pande.

DeepChem started as a Pande group project at Stanford, and is now developed by many academic and industrial collaborators. DeepChem actively encourages new academic and industrial groups to contribute!
