    "SeqToSeq Fingerprint\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use a `SeqToSeq` model to generate fingerprints for classifying molecules.  This is based on the following paper, although some of the implementation details are different: Xu et al., \"Seq2seq Fingerprint: An Unsupervised Deep Molecular Embedding for Drug Discovery\" (https://doi.org/10.1145/3107411.3107424).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many types of models require their inputs to have a fixed shape.  Since molecules can vary widely in the numbers of atoms and bonds they contain, this makes it hard to apply those models to them.  We need a way of generating a fixed length \"fingerprint\" for each molecule.  Various ways of doing this have been designed, such as Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs).  But in this example, instead of designing a fingerprint by hand, we will let a `SeqToSeq` model learn its own method of creating fingerprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `SeqToSeq` model performs sequence to sequence translation.  For example, they are often used to translate text from one language to another.  It consists of two parts called the \"encoder\" and \"decoder\".  The encoder is a stack of recurrent layers.  The input sequence is fed into it, one token at a time, and it generates a fixed length vector called the \"embedding vector\".  The decoder is another stack of recurrent layers that performs the inverse operation: it takes the embedding vector as input, and generates the output sequence.  By training it on appropriately chosen input/output pairs, you can create a model that performs many sorts of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use SMILES strings describing molecules as the input sequences.  We will train the model as an autoencoder, so it tries to make the output sequences identical to the input sequences.  For that to work, the encoder must create embedding vectors that contain all information from the original sequence.  That's exactly what we want in a fingerprint, so perhaps those embedding vectors will then be useful as a way to represent molecules in other models!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the data.  We will use the MUV dataset.  It includes 74,501 molecules in the training set, and 9313 molecules in the validation set, so it gives us plenty of SMILES strings to work with."
